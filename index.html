    <p>This website is a collection of the programmer's early experiments with HTML and CSS, 
        featuring a multi-page design that explores the basics of web development. The site includes simple 
        effects and container layouts, as well as variations of headers and footers, all created as part of
         the programmer's ongoing learning journey.</p>
